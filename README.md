# The Digital Arts Website
A website for the Digital Arts and Code community (in the building)

## If you want to edit:

1. Make a fork on Github
2. Download that fork onto your computer
3. Initialize local repository
4. Make changes to code
5. Push code back to your forked repository
6. Make a pull request to this one

## Recommendations
- VSCode has great and easy git integration, but you do not have to use it.

## TODO List
- Make top menu bar, fixed position, always on top. Three buttons probably: menu, mission, showcase. Making this responsive might be hard.
- Make stats below the initial mission goal (right-sdie of page) refer to the TODO.png
- Improve responsivity of the slanted bottom blue bar (aka maybe slanting more when screen gets smaller or something like that so its always on bottom but not intruding other parts of the screen).
- Make a read more arrow button at bottom of the page for when somebody is on mobile, as the right-side of the home page gets pushed down when screen-size < ~990px. Make the read more button dissapear if you scrolled down.
